ANSWER:
Take a look at this line: <div id="hello"><div>.
You meant to write <div id="hello"></div> but missed the slash.

This means that when ReactDOM renders your class into the hello div, it overwrites everything, because everything is inside the hello div, including itself and that other script tag. 

CONCLUSION:
I must analyze code outside a WebBrowser, before any script was invoked.
